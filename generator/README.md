# Code Generator
The code generator takes in an amount of tokens that represent a postfix equation. It then iterates through them one-by-one and outputs instructions based on the token.

## Running
To run the Code Generator, run `./generator.o`. There must be a file called tokens.bin in the directory you're running it from.
